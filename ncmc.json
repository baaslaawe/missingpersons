This location is just a few miles away from Interstate 95 and US Highway 40. She was approximately 16-25 years old, with long, curly, dark brown hair, and brown eyes.  She was petite in stature; height 5'2\"; weight 110 lbs.  With reasonable certainty, her bra size is estimated to be 34DD.  Her ears were pierced, but it did not appear she had worn earrings in quite a while.  She had a vaccination scar on the front of her left thigh; no other scars or distinguishing marks were observed.  Her teeth contained several restorations, and were in very good repair, suggesting that she had seen a dentist within a year prior to her death.  Recent ancestry testing suggests she may be of European, Italian, Greek, or Jewish descent. Her legs were stuffed inside a large cloth commercial laundry bag, which was determined to be from a laundry and dry cleaning company, located in Trenton, New Jersey.  She was found wearing only a pair of blue bikini panties, and a red ribbon, which tied her hair back. She was transported in a vehicle from an unknown location, quite possibly from another state, and tragically dumped along the side of the road.  It is estimated that she died March 17 \u2013 18, 1967, within 24 hours of being found.  The above image, suggestive of what she may have looked like in life, is a reconstruction prepared by a NCMEC Forensic Artist, based upon morgue and crime scene images.",

She stood between 5\u201900\u201d-5\u201905\u201d tall and weighed about 110-120 pounds. She had long straight brown hair. She was found wearing plaid green pants, a matching green shirt and a shawl with a green and white print. She also wore a gold ladies Baylor wrist watch and a yellow gold ring with a clear stone on her left ring finger. She also wore a thin gold chain necklace. An anthropological exam of her bones revealed that she had an orthopedic surgery to her right ankle, most likely within a few years prior to her death. Additionally, periostitis was found on her lower right leg in the process of healing. This might have caused her some pain or discomfort. A dental examination of her teeth revealed that she had extensive dental work completed. She had several fillings and a porcelain crown on one of her top middle teeth. Forensic testing of her teeth and hair determined that this female was a foreigner that arrived in the United States from between a year and 2 months before her death. The analysis determined that this female is likely from southern Europe, possibly Greece. The above images were completed by the Forensic Anthropology Department at the University of South Florida.

        "circumstance": "An unidentified female was found on December 20, 1976 in White Haven, PA in Carbon County. She was found along Lehigh River under a bridge on Interstate 80. She had been deceased about 24 hours. The female was in her third trimester of pregnancy when found. Her race is undetermined and could be Caucasian, Asian, Native American or of mixed ancestry. There is a possibility that she is of European decent such as Polish, Czech, or Silesian. The female is estimated to be 14-25 years old. She stood between 4\u201911\u201d and 5\u201904\u201d tall with dark brown hair and brown eyes. She had a 2 inch scar on her left leg, just above the heel, a small circular mole above her left eyebrow, and a mole on her left cheek. The moles on her face could have developed sometime during her pregnancy. A dental exam revealed she had four molars extracted, likely prior to the age of 12. Sometime after the extractions, she had several cavities restored. At some point after that it appears she did not receive or seek any further dental care, evidenced by a visible fracture and decay found on other teeth that could have caused her pain. The images above are facial composites created by forensic artists that depict what the female may have looked like in life.",

She had several small scars over her body. She had freckles on her shoulders and had acne on her face. Both of her ears were pierced but she was not wearing any earrings. An exam of her teeth suggested that within 1-2 years prior to her death she may have suffered from discomfort and possibly severe pain in her mouth from untreated cavities. This may have caused her difficulty chewing on one side of her mouth or she may have showed outward signs of discomfort. She also might not have showed any discomfort. She was tanned and had visible bikini lines. She was wearing tan corduroy jeans, multi-colored plaid shirt, blue knee socks, brown shoes (size 8) and a red windbreaker jacket. She also wore a silver beaded necklace with 3 small turquoise birds around her neck and a silver keychain with a heart bearing the inscription \u201cHe who holds the key can open my heart\u201d and a key that fits into the corresponding heart, around the front belt loop of her pants.

The second female was a child, 5-11 years old. Both of her ears were doubled pierced. She had no dental fillings. She may been ill at the time of her disappearance as the autopsy revealed evidence of pneumonia in one of her lungs.  DNA testing confirms that these two females are maternally related. On May 9, 2000 two additional unidentified female children were found inside a 55 gallon metal barrel in the same area where the first bodies were discovered 15 years earlier. One female was 2-4 years old. She had no dental restorations but she did have a noticeable overbite.  The other female was the youngest of the victims at 1-3 years old. She had no dental restorations but did have a slight gap between her upper two front teeth. This youngest child was also determined to be maternally related to the first two victims found in 1985. The 2-4 year old has not yet been biologically linked to the other victims. No clothing or jewelry were found with the victims.

It is estimated that she had been deceased less than 2 weeks prior to being found. The female is estimated to be between 17-20 years old and had brown hair that was styled up and held in place with bobby pins and an elastic ponytail holder. She had a pierced naval and was wearing a silver naval ring. Both ears were also doubled pierced. The female was found clothed wearing a long sleeve brown and beige striped pullover shirt (Croquet, size small), white bibbed overalls (Union Bay, size small), white socks, and brown shoes (LA Gear, size 6 \u00bd ). Additionally she wore a gold herring bone necklace, a ring with a pink stone, and a Gitano brand watch. The female has been connected to an adult Jane Doe recovered in Tolland, MA about a week later on October 6, 1995. DNA testing revealed that these unidentified females share a mother-to-daughter relationship. This adult female is estimated to be 30-45 years old.

The second female was a child, 5-11 years old. Both of her ears were doubled pierced. She had no dental fillings. She may been ill at the time of her disappearance as the autopsy revealed evidence of pneumonia in one of her lungs.  DNA testing confirms that these two females are maternally related. On May 9, 2000 two additional unidentified female children were found inside a 55 gallon metal barrel in the same area where the first bodies were discovered 15 years earlier. One female was 2-4 years old. She had no dental restorations but she did have a noticeable overbite.  The other female was the youngest of the victims at 1-3 years old. She had no dental restorations but did have a slight gap between her upper two front teeth. This youngest child was also determined to be maternally related to the first two victims found in 1985. The 2-4 year old has not yet been biologically linked to the other victims. No clothing or jewelry were found with the victims.

        "circumstance": "On November 10, 1985 two unidentified females were found near an overturned 55 gallon metal barrel on a wooded trail adjacent to Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown. One of the females is an adult believed to be 22-33 years old. She had light brown, fine wavy hair. She had several dental fillings and 3 teeth had been removed. The second female was a child, 5-11 years old. Both of her ears were doubled pierced. She had no dental fillings. She may been ill at the time of her disappearance as the autopsy revealed evidence of pneumonia in one of her lungs.  DNA testing confirms that these two females are maternally related. On May 9, 2000 two additional unidentified female children were found inside a 55 gallon metal barrel in the same area where the first bodies were discovered 15 years earlier. One female was 2-4 years old. She had no dental restorations but she did have a noticeable overbite.  The other female was the youngest of the victims at 1-3 years old. She had no dental restorations but did have a slight gap between her upper two front teeth. This youngest child was also determined to be maternally related to the first two victims found in 1985. The 2-4 year old has not yet been biologically linked to the other victims. No clothing or jewelry were found with the victims. It is estimated that all four have been deceased for the same amount of time and died prior to 1985. Images above are facial reconstructions completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist.",

She had a scar on the back of her left hand and a scar near the top of her left shoulder.  She was found wearing a red halter top, blue jeans with a zipper on the side and round eyelets on the waistband (\u201cWatch LA\u201d brand), blue underwear, and black slip on dress shoes with 3\u201d wedge heels (\u201cLower Eastside\u201d brand, size 6 1/2). She had a purple bracelet and an elastic hair tie on her right wrist.  She was wearing faded purple nail polish on her fingernails.  It is believed the victim hitchhiked to Tempe from Phoenix, and was likely picked up near 32nd Street and Greenway Road in Phoenix, Arizona on 04/26/2002. The decedent died of a drug overdose and reportedly told a driver who picked her up that she had been kicked out of her home due to drug use.  The victim may have been a Spanish speaker.  The facial reconstruction featured above is an artist\u2019s rendering of what the victim may have looked like.

It was estimated that he had been deceased for several days before he was found.  The male is thought to be of Hispanic descent and had short black hair.  It was estimated that he was in his late teens to very early twenties, stood between 5\u20191\u201d and 5\u20193\u201d tall, and weighed 135 lbs.  Earlier in life, the male had broken his nose and right big toe.  The male had two homemade stippled tattoos.  One of them was on his left hand between his thumb and pointer finger and depicted the letters \u201cUL\u201d.  The other tattoo which was found on his forearm was illegible.  The male was found wearing a black short sleeved shirt with the letter \u201cZ\u201d and a Starter Brand logo on the front.  He was also wearing brown corduroy pants with a black webbed belt, brown socks, and white NIKE shoes.  The shoes had blue accents and had blue and white soles with the word \u201cFlight\u201d written on the side.  A red BIC lighter was also found in the male\u2019s pocket.  An anthropological assessment of his bones showed that he may have had poor nutrition or chronic sickness during childhood, and he may have been a migrant worker who grew up outside of the United States.  The image above is a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what the male may have looked like in life.  Two images are renderings of the tattoos on his hand and arm.

It is estimated that she had been deceased for several months prior to being found and likely died during the Summer or Fall of 2008. The Jane Doe is 15-21 years old and thought to be Caucasian, but Hispanic and Native American cannot be ruled out. She had long light brown to dark blond hair. She stood between 4\u201910\u201d-5\u201904\u201d tall and weighed between 110-135 pounds. Her teeth were in good condition with good alignment. She had fillings in four of her bottom molars. Anthropological examination also revealed that she had Spina Bifida Occulta, but possibly never knew she had this condition. It is also suggested that she might have been knock kneed or pigeon toed, where her feet turned slightly inward. A well healed fracture to one of her left ribs was also found suggesting she suffered some type of injury earlier in life. The Jane Doe was found wearing a black shirt (size small) and jeans (size 3) as pictured above. The clothing was most likely purchased at a Family Dollar Store or general retailer.
