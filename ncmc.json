Two iron assayer\u2019s molds were also found wrapped in the quilt.  The child may have suffered from Downs Syndrome or another congenital illness. The child was found wearing a red long-sleeved shirt with horizontal thin white stripes, gray corduroy pants with an elastic waist and a buckle for size adjustment, ankle socks and size 3 white shoes known as \"Jumping Jacks\".

        "circumstance": "On March 18, 1967, this unidentified, Caucasian female's body was found off the shoulder of Porter Road, a rural area in Bear, New Castle County, Delaware.  This location is just a few miles away from Interstate 95 and US Highway 40. She was approximately 16-25 years old, with long, curly, dark brown hair, and brown eyes.  She was petite in stature; height 5'2\"; weight 110 lbs.  With reasonable certainty, her bra size is estimated to be 34DD.  Her ears were pierced, but it did not appear she had worn earrings in quite a while.  She had a vaccination scar on the front of her left thigh; no other scars or distinguishing marks were observed.  Her teeth contained several restorations, and were in very good repair, suggesting that she had seen a dentist within a year prior to her death.  Recent ancestry testing suggests she may be of European, Italian, Greek, or Jewish descent. Her legs were stuffed inside a large cloth commercial laundry bag, which was determined to be from a laundry and dry cleaning company, located in Trenton, New Jersey.  She was found wearing only a pair of blue bikini panties, and a red ribbon, which tied her hair back. She was transported in a vehicle from an unknown location, quite possibly from another state, and tragically dumped along the side of the road.  It is estimated that she died March 17 \u2013 18, 1967, within 24 hours of being found.  The above image, suggestive of what she may have looked like in life, is a reconstruction prepared by a NCMEC Forensic Artist, based upon morgue and crime scene images.",

Based on the condition of the remains, it is believed she could have been deceased for up to one year prior to recovery.  She had kinky hair that was described as \"multicolored\" (red, brown and black). She had long manicured fingernails and a gap between her upper front teeth which would have been noticeable to her family and friends. She was found wearing an orange/yellow skirt with a 27\" waist and 34\" hip, a full 34\", a white slip with lace trim, a white short sleeve turtleneck sweater, and white socks. Based on her clothing sizes, she may have appeared tall and thin.  She was also found wearing a yellow metal 1957 \"Bulova\" brand ladies watch (shown above). The watch had a yellow metal expansion band with a broken link and bore serial number T556641.  Anyone with information should contact the Los Angeles County Coroner, reference case number 717384.",

It is estimated that she had been deceased for several weeks. The Jane Doe was 17-25 years old at the time of her death. She stood between 5\u201900\u201d-5\u201905\u201d tall and weighed about 110-120 pounds. She had long straight brown hair. She was found wearing plaid green pants, a matching green shirt and a shawl with a green and white print. She also wore a gold ladies Baylor wrist watch and a yellow gold ring with a clear stone on her left ring finger. She also wore a thin gold chain necklace. An anthropological exam of her bones revealed that she had an orthopedic surgery to her right ankle, most likely within a few years prior to her death. Additionally, periostitis was found on her lower right leg in the process of healing. This might have caused her some pain or discomfort. A dental examination of her teeth revealed that she had extensive dental work completed. She had several fillings and a porcelain crown on one of her top middle teeth. Forensic testing of her teeth and hair determined that this female was a foreigner that arrived in the United States from between a year and 2 months before her death. The analysis determined that this female is likely from southern Europe, possibly Greece. The above images were completed by the Forensic Anthropology Department at the University of South Florida. One is a facial reconstruction of what the female may have looked like in life. The second is a composite of the clothing she was found wearing.",

The child had a gray-blue discoloration on their teeth, possibly due to the use of antibiotics or tetracyclines.

There is a possibility that she is of European decent such as Polish, Czech, or Silesian. The female is estimated to be 14-25 years old.

She had a 2 inch scar on her left leg, just above the heel, a small circular mole above her left eyebrow, and a mole on her left cheek. The moles on her face could have developed sometime during her pregnancy. A dental exam revealed she had four molars extracted, likely prior to the age of 12. Sometime after the extractions, she had several cavities restored. At some point after that it appears she did not receive or seek any further dental care, evidenced by a visible fracture and decay found on other teeth that could have caused her pain.

She had several small scars over her body. She had freckles on her shoulders and had acne on her face. Both of her ears were pierced but she was not wearing any earrings. An exam of her teeth suggested that within 1-2 years prior to her death she may have suffered from discomfort and possibly severe pain in her mouth from untreated cavities. This may have caused her difficulty chewing on one side of her mouth or she may have showed outward signs of discomfort. She also might not have showed any discomfort. She was tanned and had visible bikini lines. She was wearing tan corduroy jeans, multi-colored plaid shirt, blue knee socks, brown shoes (size 8) and a red windbreaker jacket.

The body was that of a white female, approximately 18 months old. She had been deceased less than two days before being found. The child was approximately 2\u20195\" tall and weighed around 25 pounds. Her eye color was indecipherable but was possibly brown or blue. Her hair color was strawberry blonde. The child was found wearing a pink and white checkered \"Cradle Togs\" dress or shirt and a disposable diaper. She had 12 teeth and appeared to have been well-nourished and cared for. Witnesses recall seeing a young adult female, carrying a baby walking along the Interstate a few nights prior to when her body was found. Authorities believe the baby seen by witnesses could be this unidentified child. The adult female has never been located or identified.  The image above is a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what the child may have looked like in life.",

        "circumstance": "On November 10, 1985 two unidentified females were found near an overturned 55 gallon metal barrel on a wooded trail adjacent to Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown. One of the females is an adult believed to be 22-33 years old. She had light brown, fine wavy hair. She had several dental fillings and 3 teeth had been removed. The second female was a child, 5-11 years old. Both of her ears were doubled pierced. She had no dental fillings. She may been ill at the time of her disappearance as the autopsy revealed evidence of pneumonia in one of her lungs.  DNA testing confirms that these two females are maternally related. On May 9, 2000 two additional unidentified female children were found inside a 55 gallon metal barrel in the same area where the first bodies were discovered 15 years earlier. One female was 2-4 years old. She had no dental restorations but she did have a noticeable overbite.  The other female was the youngest of the victims at 1-3 years old. She had no dental restorations but did have a slight gap between her upper two front teeth. This youngest child was also determined to be maternally related to the first two victims found in 1985. The 2-4 year old has not yet been biologically linked to the other victims. No clothing or jewelry were found with the victims. It is estimated that all four have been deceased for the same amount of time and died prior to 1985. Images above are facial reconstructions completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist.",

        "circumstance": "An unidentified female was found deceased on February 6, 1986 in Tampa, Florida. Her body was found along 2nd Ave between 31st and 34th street in an industrial area of Tampa. She had likely been deceased three to eight weeks prior to being found. The female is estimated to be 16-22 years old. She stood approximately 5\u201902\u201d tall. She was African American and had \u201ckinky brown hair\u201d according to the original police report. An anthropological exam revealed that the female had sustained injuries to the left side of her head and nose earlier in life which likely caused her to have a deviated septum. Several congenital defects were also seen in her spine but it is unknown whether they would have caused her any physical discomfort. The female may have even been unaware of the defects. The female\u2019s teeth were in very poor condition and some of the untreated teeth were likely causing her pain. Forensic testing has suggested the female was most likely born and raised in Florida.  The images above are various angles of a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depict what the female may have looked like in life.",

Another body of an adult male between the ages of 35-45 was found with this young male. The adult male is also unidentified. Forensic testing has suggested that both males are paternally related, but their specific relationship is unknown.

Additionally she wore a gold herring bone necklace, a ring with a pink stone, and a Gitano brand watch. The female has been connected to an adult Jane Doe recovered in Tolland, MA about a week later on October 6, 1995.

She wore maroon prescription eyeglasses and had partial upper and lower dentures. She wore several rings, a gold Sergio Valente wristwatch and her ears were pierced. The investigation has revealed that the females likely resided or frequented the upstate New York area around Albany.

        "circumstance": "An unidentified female was found deceased on march 5, 1996 in a wooded area off Falls Road in Baltimore County, Maryland. She had been deceased for several years. The female is approximately 17-19 years old. She stood between 5\u201901\u201d-5\u201904\u201d tall. Her weight, hair and eye color cannot be determined. An anthropological exam reported the female had sacralization of the 5th lumbar vertebra which may have caused her some discomfort in her lower back. The exam also revealed a premature obliteration of the sagittal sinus and a small boney anomaly on her skull that may have been a congenital defect or evidence of past trauma she endured. The female was found wearing denim pants with small zippers along the side (size 7/8), a web belt, a light colored blouse with dark pinstripes and pearl buttons, an imitation leather jacket that zippered up the front and high-top boots with Velcro fasteners. Two yellow metal hoop earrings were also found near the female but it is unknown if they belonged to her. The images above are different artists\u2019 rendition of a facial reconstruction depicting what the female may have looked like in life, along with an enhanced image of the shoes and earrings found with the female.",

It was estimated that he was in his late teens to very early twenties, stood between 5\u20191\u201d and 5\u20193\u201d tall, and weighed 135 lbs.  Earlier in life, the male had broken his nose and right big toe.  The male had two homemade stippled tattoos.  One of them was on his left hand between his thumb and pointer finger and depicted the letters \u201cUL\u201d.  The other tattoo which was found on his forearm was illegible.  The male was found wearing a black short sleeved shirt with the letter \u201cZ\u201d and a Starter Brand logo on the front.  He was also wearing brown corduroy pants with a black webbed belt, brown socks, and white NIKE shoes.  The shoes had blue accents and had blue and white soles with the word \u201cFlight\u201d written on the side.  A red BIC lighter was also found in the male\u2019s pocket.  An anthropological assessment of his bones showed that he may have had poor nutrition or chronic sickness during childhood, and he may have been a migrant worker who grew up outside of the United States.  The image above is a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what the male may have looked like in life.  Two images are renderings of the tattoos on his hand and arm. The last image is an enhanced image of the shoe the male was wearing.",

She was located in a small creek near an abandoned farm off Skyline Drive, which is about 1 mile, North of Highway 28 and East of Interstate 41. It is estimated that she had been deceased for several months prior to being found and likely died during the Summer or Fall of 2008. The Jane Doe is 15-21 years old and thought to be Caucasian, but Hispanic and Native American cannot be ruled out. She had long light brown to dark blond hair. She stood between 4\u201910\u201d-5\u201904\u201d tall and weighed between 110-135 pounds. Her teeth were in good condition with good alignment. She had fillings in four of her bottom molars. Anthropological examination also revealed that she had Spina Bifida Occulta, but possibly never knew she had this condition. It is also suggested that she might have been knock kneed or pigeon toed, where her feet turned slightly inward. A well healed fracture to one of her left ribs was also found suggesting she suffered some type of injury earlier in life. The Jane Doe was found wearing a black shirt (size small) and jeans (size 3) as pictured above. The clothing was most likely purchased at a Family Dollar Store or general retailer. The first three images above are a reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and shows what the female may have looked like while alive.",
