Working with Missing Persons Data
=====

While there are a number of public facing databases containing missing persons data, I have chosen to work with 

- National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) www.missingkids.com and 
- National Missing and Unidentified Persons Systems Missing Persons Database www.findthemissing.org. 

Unfortunately both do not have public facing APIs or share a common data standard. 

Data was scraped from NCMEC utilizing its underlying JSON API, while NamUs data was gathered using Selenium. Data from both sources were cleaned, standardized and linked if duplicated.
