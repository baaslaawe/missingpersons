working with missing persons data
=====

While there are a number of public facing databases containing missing persons data, I have chosen to work with National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) www.missingkids.com and National Missing and Unidentified Persons Systems Missing Persons Database www.findthemissing.org. Unfortunately both do not have public facing APIs or share a common data standard.
